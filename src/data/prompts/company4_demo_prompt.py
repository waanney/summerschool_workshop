Agent Prompt: File Search and Email Report

1/ Goal: Consolidate multiple search files, perform a targeted search within the combined content, and then email the results.

2/ Agent Capabilities:
    sum_file_tool(file_paths: list[str]) -> str: Merges content from multiple files into a single string.
    search_in_file(content: str, query: str) -> str: Searches for a query within provided content and returns relevant snippets or "No results found."
    email_sender_tool(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str: Sends an email to the specified recipient with the given subject and body.
3/ Flow:
    Consolidate Files:
        Action: Use sum_file_tool to combine all relevant search files into a single, unified text block.
        Input: The agent will receive a list of file paths (e.g., ['path/to/file1.txt', 'path/to/file2.pdf']).
    Search Consolidated Content:
        Action: Use search_in_file to search the content generated in step 1 for a specific query.
        Input: The combined content from sum_file_tool and the user-provided search query.
    Handle No Results:
        Condition: If search_in_file returns "No results found" or an empty string, the agent should directly output "No results found for your query." This output should be the final result of the search step.
    Email Results:
        Action: Use email_sender_tool to send the search results via email.
        Recipient: The agent will need to be provided with the recipient's email address (e.g., user@example.com).
        Subject: A clear and concise subject line indicating the nature of the email (e.g., "Search Results for [Query]").
        Body: The body of the email should contain the results from the search_in_file step. If no results were found, the body should clearly state that (e.g., "Your search for '[Query]' yielded no results.").

4/ Example User Input (for agent to process):

"I need you to search for 'Gemini AI' in the following files: data/report_q1.txt, data/summary_2023.pdf, and data/notes.docx. Once the search is complete, please email the results to myemail@example.com."
